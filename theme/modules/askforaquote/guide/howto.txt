The following code samples will help you add the quotation button anywhere on your website (product list, featured products etc.).

Follow the guide carefully for each file as you might end up with errors or a non-working shop!

AND DO ALWAYS MAKE A BACKUP FIRST OF THE FILE YOU WANT TO EDIT

Steps:

1. Open the file you need to edit - product_list.tpl if you want to add the button to the category / product list page


2. Add the code from "add-to-head.txt" file to the beginning of the template (after the comment part, before any {if} section)


3. Locate the product image insert (usually inside the link with class "product_img_link") and add a class to it like this: image{$product.id_product}
So if before was:
<img class="replace-2x img-responsive" src=
Now should look like this:
<img class="image{$product.id_product} replace-2x img-responsive" src=


4. Find the "Add to cart" button and add the code found in "add-to-source.txt" after or before!
(actually it can be inserted anywhere, but make sure it's inside the {foreach} cycle)


5. Save the file and you're done!


PLEASE NOTE that we added a "product_list_sample.tpl" file for reference!

POST SCRIPTUM 2: this will not take the category permissions of the module into consideration!
